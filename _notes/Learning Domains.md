 In the 1950s, an educational theorist named Benjamin Bloom proposed a significant concept that completely changed the way we think about education and learning. If you're an educator, you may be familiar with Bloom's Taxonomy. As part of his theory, Bloom suggested that learning happens across three different but interconnected domains.

The cognitive domain is probably the one most of us associate with learning, it's all about the head. It's knowledge and facts and concepts. But there were two more that Bloom said were just as important. The affective domain, as he called it, had to do with the heart. It was about emotions or affections. And finally, the behavioral domain was about the hands and feet. People learn by doing, and experimenting, by action.

Transformative learning, the kind that changes a person, happens when all three of these domains are included in the learning process.
