Gospel Saturation is the idea that every man, woman, and child in a region would have access to the gospel in a way they understand.

In Scripture, we see this goal described by Luke in the summary statements he provides concerning the [[Mission of the Church]]. In each instance, Luke now how the Word of the Lord increased, spread, multiplied, and even prevailed.[[*list references here*::rsn]] Like records that all within a region had heard the Word of the Lord.[[*cite references*::rsn]]
