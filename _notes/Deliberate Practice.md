The term Deliberate Practice was coined by K. Anders Ericsson in a 1993 article for the *Psychological Review*. The primary point of the study was that expertise is not necessarily natural born but is instead the result of deliberate practices.

>The theoretical framework presented in this article explains expert performance as the end result of individuals' prolonged efforts to improve performance while negotiating motivational and external constraints.[[[Ericsson](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf), 1993, 363.::rsn]]
