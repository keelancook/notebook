Because of my work, I do a lot of digging around for good deals on Christian scholarship. I frequently turn to Amazon for those deals, as they have excellent Kindle sales. I also use [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/keelan4) to compile my reading notes, and it integrates beautifully with Kindle. 
[[The Readise link uses a referral code that gives you an additional free trial month if you sign up with it. It does not give me any additional benefit, but I like the service enough, I would recommend it to you.::rmn]]

Periodically, I'll list books I find here so others can know about them as well. Let me go ahead and mention that placing a book on this list does *not* mean I endorse it or the theology therein. I believe we should read widely and outside our own tradition, and this list will reflect that philosophy.
[[The Amazon links on this page may provide me with a small compensation if you choose to purchase a book. Hopefully, the little bit of money from that helps cover costs of hosting and other fees I incur in order to maintain this online space.::rmn]]

*Caveat emptor*: Kindle sales are usually for a limited time. I'll post the books here when they go on sale, but the price may change after a day or two.
