## Main Takeaway
This was perhaps the best book I read in 2020. 

Ortland's work is both educational and devotional, wedding a slow-motion look at the Scriptures concerning the character of Christ with a devotional tone that carries the reader toward genuine worship.

This book didn't just teach me something new about God, it increased my affections for him.
